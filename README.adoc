= Release Management Tool for Maven/node.js projects

== Introduction

The application finds all pom.xml files as well as all package.json and bower.json recursively and updates them to a given version.

For pom files it also adds -SNAPSHOT in the version (if applicable).

== Usage

. Copy the maven-produced jar in the root folder of the project you want to release.
. run with `java -jar jar-name.jar`
.. run `bump [action]` where action is `major`, `minor`, `build`, `prod`, `snapshot` or
.. run `release [version]` where version is of the form `ddd.ddd.ddd[-SNAPSHOT]`

Examples:

 $ bump minor

 $ release 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT

 $ release 1.0.2
